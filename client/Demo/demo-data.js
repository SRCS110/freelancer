Close 2 new retainer clients at $2k+/mo each.

2. What revenue target are you aiming for?
$18k total revenue for the quarter. Currently at $11,975 — need $6k more.

3. What new skill or capability do you want to build?
Motion design basics in After Effects. Would expand service offering significantly.

4. What should you stop doing or cut?
Taking on small one-off logo jobs under $1,500. Not worth the context switching.

5. Who do you need to connect with or hire?
A part-time project manager or VA to handle admin, scheduling, and client comms.

6. How will you measure success?
MRR at $6k+ by Sept 30. Portfolio site live. 2 new case studies published.`,
